LLM Usage and Considerations

This project does not currently utilize any Large Language Models (LLMs) in its core functionality. The project is focused on data analysis and visualization of cryptocurrency funding rates.

Future Considerations:
1. Potential for using LLMs to:
   - Generate natural language summaries of funding rate patterns
   - Provide trading strategy recommendations based on historical patterns
   - Analyze market sentiment from funding rate movements

2. Data Privacy:
   - All data processing is done locally
   - No data is sent to external LLM services
   - Raw funding rate data is stored in CSV format

3. Performance:
   - Current implementation focuses on efficient data processing
   - No LLM-related latency concerns
   - Direct data analysis without intermediate language model processing

4. Dependencies:
   - No LLM-related dependencies in requirements.txt
   - Standard data science and visualization libraries only

### Project Summary: "HYOE" Delta-Neutral Funding Rate Arbitrage Strategy Analysis

This project is a comprehensive suite of tools for backtesting and analyzing a delta-neutral funding rate arbitrage strategy for the "HYPE" cryptocurrency on the Hyperliquid exchange.

**The Strategy:**
The core of the project is a trading strategy that aims to profit from funding rates in perpetual futures markets while remaining neutral to price movements. It involves shorting a perpetual contract while simultaneously holding an equivalent amount of the underlying spot asset. The strategy enters trades when the perpetual price is at a premium to the spot price and the funding rate is positive, and it has specific exit conditions based on stop-loss, premium collapse, or a drop in the funding rate.

**The Workflow:**
The project can be broken down into four main stages:

**1. Data Discovery (Utility Scripts):**
These scripts help in finding what data is available on the exchange before fetching it.
-   `find_first_candle.py`: Finds the earliest available candle data for an asset.
-   `scan_candles_range.py`: Scans a date range to identify periods with available candle data.
-   `funding_data_range_check.py`: Finds the date range for which funding rate data is available.

**2. Data Fetching:**
These scripts are responsible for collecting the necessary data from the Hyperliquid API.
-   `fetch_funding_data.py`: Fetches historical funding rate data and saves it as `hype_funding_rates_1min.csv`.
-   `fetch_candles.py`: Fetches historical OHLCV candle data for a specific, short period and saves it to `candles.json` and `candles.csv`.
-   `fetch_price_data.py`: Fetches live spot and perpetual price data (seems to be for live monitoring rather than historical analysis).
-   `fetch.py`: A general-purpose script for fetching historical candle data.

**3. Backtesting:**
This is the core of the project, where the strategy is simulated on historical data.
-   `end.py` and `endi.py`: Both files contain the backtesting engine (`simulate_delta_neutral` function). They take a combined dataset of spot prices, perpetual prices, and funding rates as input. `end.py` is streamlined to produce `trades.csv`, while `endi.py` seems to be a more detailed version for interactive analysis with more plots and statistics.
-   **Input Data:** Both backtesting scripts read from a file named `"data (1).csv"`. This file seems to be a crucial, pre-processed file that combines all the necessary time series data. **The creation of this file is the main missing link in the automated workflow.**

**4. Reporting and Analysis:**
After running the backtest, these scripts are used to analyze and report the results.
-   `generate_report.py`: Reads the `trades.csv` file produced by `end.py` and generates a comprehensive financial report in markdown format (`report.md`), including various performance metrics and an equity curve/drawdown plot.
-   `main.py` / `funding_analysis.py` (identical scripts): Perform a specific analysis on 15-minute funding rate data, calculating statistics and generating a plot.
-   `resample_funding_data.py`: Resamples 15-minute funding data to 24-hour data and generates a plot.

**Missing Pieces and Inconsistencies:**
-   **The "Golden" CSV:** The most significant missing piece is the script that generates `"data (1).csv"`. This file is the input to the backtesting engine and presumably contains the merged and time-aligned spot, perpetual, and funding rate data.
-   **Data Resampling:** The workflow for resampling the 1-minute funding data from `fetch_funding_data.py` into the 15-minute, 6-hour, and 24-hour versions is not explicitly defined in a single script. While `resample_funding_data.py` handles one case (15min -> 24h), the other steps are missing.
-   **Redundancy:** There's redundancy in the codebase, with `main.py` and `funding_analysis.py` being identical, and `end.py` and `endi.py` being two different versions of the same backtesting logic.
-   **`README.md`:** The `README.md` is slightly out of date. It misrepresents `main.py` as an orchestrator and refers to a non-existent `requirements.txt` file.

**Conclusion:**
The "hyoe" project is a sophisticated and well-structured tool for analyzing a specific, complex trading strategy. While it contains some redundant code and is missing a key data preparation step, the core components for data fetching, backtesting, and reporting are all present and appear to be functional. The project's author has clearly put a lot of effort into building a robust analysis pipeline.
