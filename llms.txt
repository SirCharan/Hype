LLM Usage and Considerations

This project does not currently utilize any Large Language Models (LLMs) in its core functionality. The project is focused on data analysis and visualization of cryptocurrency funding rates.

Future Considerations:
1. Potential for using LLMs to:
   - Generate natural language summaries of funding rate patterns
   - Provide trading strategy recommendations based on historical patterns
   - Analyze market sentiment from funding rate movements

2. Data Privacy:
   - All data processing is done locally
   - No data is sent to external LLM services
   - Raw funding rate data is stored in CSV format

3. Performance:
   - Current implementation focuses on efficient data processing
   - No LLM-related latency concerns
   - Direct data analysis without intermediate language model processing

4. Dependencies:
   - No LLM-related dependencies in requirements.txt
   - Standard data science and visualization libraries only
